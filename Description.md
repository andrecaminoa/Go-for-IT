Go-for-IT
=========

Synopsis

Go for IT [IT stands for Interstellar Travel, you know] will be a web-based game, with extension apps for OS and Android Systems. It will be mainly oriented for kids, from 4 to almost 40 years [just like me!] and older.

This game will runs over a real time simulation of our Solar System, with accurate and precise data gathered from existent scientific data mining, and that it going to be updated periodically.

As a work premise, when we will have the complete capability of reach a near star, for instance Alpha Centauri, in about 100 years or less, there should be a high likelihood that we have developed our Solar System before.

This game will be about the technology and infrastructures required to the complete development of the Solar System, helping our civilization to reach a sustainable Kardashev I Level, transforming it into a wealthy Kardashev II Level society by unlocking the vast resources that surround us, and preparing us to achieve Kardashev III Level, being a mature civilization capable of Interstellar Travel.

Objectives

• It will inspire young people to cultivate their interests in Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (S.T.E.M).

• It will be a real time simulation, according to the most accurate and precise scientific data, providing a dynamic and zoom-able view of our Solar System.

• It will offer the design and build of infrastructures required for bootstrap the space industry.

• It will be a platform for crowd-sourcing data analysis, and test validation of celestial bodies’ motion and gravitational models, and planetary mechanics theories in general.

Modules / Stages

• You are here (learning module):  a comprehensive three dimensional map, showing a dynamic view of our position in the Solar System, scalable to the Sun’s Stellar Neighborhood, and to the whole Milky Way Galaxy. Our kids and all of us need to see the true sense and  scale of our anthropocentric point of view. This feature will be the first to be developed.

• We can do it (gaming module): dream and play, design and build a simulation of the bases, logistics, facilities, and outposts required for complete development, and colonization of our Solar System.

Players / Roles

• Learners: geared for kids and public in general. They will find a highly visual and comprehensive tool to explore the Solar System and learn everything that they want about it.

• Thinkers: this role is for innovative like-minded players that wants to design the game, improving it, adding complexity and visualizing obstacles to tackle.

• Doers: frequent and advanced players that build the required infrastructures.
